This mod aims to optimize the general performance of Minecraft(mob ai, game physics, chunk loading, etc..) without changing any behavior. It works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod**. With the mod installed, you can see on average a **45% improvement to server tick times**, resulting in a much leaner game.\n\nEven in single-player, your game runs an \"integrated server\" which ticks the world your player is in. Through optimizing the server-side of the game, this can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and responsiveness**. For multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players.\n\n*(Note: Canary is stable at this point but also --issues are expected, also as mentioned above Canary is unofficial fork that means it has not been created by CaffeineMC team. So please report any issues you have to me only from here.*\n\n### Installation\n\nCanary only supports Minecraft Forge 1.18.2 and up, So make sure you have the latest version of Forge present and simply drop the mod into your mods folder, no other mods or additional setup is required!\n\n### Features\n\nCanary contains all the optimizations of Lithium, You might be curious by now as to what exactly Canary is doing in order to achieve such significant gains, and I'm happy you are! You can read about (some) of the changes below.\n\n**Physics optimizations:** Entity collision detection has seen significant improvements through reducing the collision resolution complexity for simple, cuboid blocks. A more accurate algorithm is also used to reduce the number of blocks being checked every tick, especially in cases where entities are moving very quickly.\n\n**Mob AI optimizations:** We make use of an event-based system for some tasks in order to reduce the CPU usage incurred by constantly polling the world for changes. Mob \"brains\" have also been optimized to select between different AI tasks much, much quicker than before. Comparison before and after here.\n\n**World generation optimizations:** Many calculations in vanilla's world generation are unnecessary and do not affect the final result, which gives ample opportunity for Canary to optimize this overhead away.\n\n**Chunk loading optimizations:** The temporary data structures used in block palette compaction have been changed to be much more efficient. This results in fewer TPS drops while players are exploring terrain and provides a modest boost to world load times. We also batch some verification operations to reduce unnecessary disk I/O.\n\n**Mob farm optimizations:** Mob cramming is significantly less expensive as resolving collisions between entities has been optimized to take advantage of the fact that simple boxes are involved. This makes mob farms considerably less harmful for server tick rates.\n\n**Block ticking optimizations**: has less overhead, making things such as block update settling after generating chunks and other Redstone contraptions faster. This also reduces the amount of time it takes for a block to determine if it is ticking by schedule from O(n), where n is the number of ticking blocks, to O(1), providing a significant speedup when many blocks are being ticked.\n\n**Explosion optimizations:** Many optimizations have been applied to TNT and explosions alike, reducing their associated lag without changing how they behave. In particular, ray-tracing is optimized to take advantage of the fact that multiple steps through a way will occur in the same block position, allowing us to quickly re-use the previous step's results. We also make use of a faster position tracking algorithm which avoids many excessive allocations.\n\n**Point of Interest optimizations:** Complex mob AIs in Minecraft, primarily those belonging to Villagers and Pillagers, often need to find relevant points of interest in the world in order to choose the most appropriate AI task. In vanilla, querying all points within a chunk requires 16 separate retrievals through stream-heavy code. With Canary present, this task is reduced to a single simple retrieval that makes use of a much faster (and traditional) iterator based approach, yielding anywhere from a 16-22x improvement for queries.\n\n**Data Tracker optimizations:** The internal data manager used for tracking some entity state and properties has been optimized to use flat arrays and avoid expensive locking, providing a decent boost whenever these attributes are accessed during a game tick.\n\n**Redstone Wire optimizations:** Calculating the new power level of redstone wire after a block update is costly. Reducing the number of blockstate checks without any change in behavior reduces redstone dust lag by about 35%.\n\n... And other internal improvements to help the JVM better optimize code.\n \n### Configuration\n\nMuch like Lithium, Canary makes use of an unusual configuration system which can be used to enable or disable certain patches. For more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/Canary/wiki/Configuration-File).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nMuch like Lithium, this is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:14:22.028344Z","updated":"2023-07-27T20:54:01.191504Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":66139,"followers":140,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["jArn18gq","DeZyKkoh","YLptv3gY","vLnEz4Jk","QoHgoUez","630Uuhum","UwDsOziG","9rV72WpH","2EtN3XTA","zhqljn3Q","atrfkrEJ","ICblBYXF","PypZeIuM","G9wpkcBs","yifS9jNc","fVaVgOpe","WjDymkLy","jiljfkkF","WmdwuZCo","FPHheHCc","A1AhgCn6","ZXffo9kC","TPI87JnK","zr2IEDV6","QZqtvjet","VdJ59BbS","ZrGV2F1I","xLlo3yjN","Ud24AKmW","nb6pFSvG","eXwCI6yf","nZRwdF8v","cUhhW3wi","9Zv8xPuy","DhpJ1jxs","DiE1gIxe","kTSo1GCp","FtWglNX8","l0P3FJwx","FbLb4Ucu","BXS19h1f","AASYIFl1","n72gvih6","SAnjWBGk","sIc9LXIn","SOco8NAK","5lKmJ9yT","umf6wyAx","epbUPaCx","pfEKLmDJ","7imJufXu","eei6bAjg","ObfM0BsK","h5Ls1xeD","QtErbnSX","6o7AeOrz","aInG8ARC","EoRiIRCJ","jMAxD8Cx","OQDjW5pb","2ipRmY3M","T4yRVmge","l5ovPLmS","Ky0jp694","EWj5VGbH","rdHeE0B2","cjyOKKa5","LaKiAYF7","eXCrRKVC","8eRYepVl","RvcqTsxC","V6nY8ZpR","LE99Zz6p","NBQ1tGmZ","NZE8AZVj","Oslo7xK4","b8QqzhYT","FReV3YPW","pktaNaG5","UgJanwuo","VIre5UC7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qa2H4BS9/5e5697fc3bab569b83b10dd816f4aac396b5e677.png"},"version":{"id":"VIre5UC7","project_id":"qa2H4BS9","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Canary 0.2.7 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.2.7","changelog":"Fix the running behaviors are not ticked.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-27T20:54:02.278363Z","downloads":18026,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"32f07064b50444c986bcfdddbe83270726fddfb1","sha512":"9e2a69cc4e38111f527dbc10337e026b2b773cea92cf6d2f68e850437dd91e923799f36b82201ebce98c436c7e0dce65a8e8563b032453445b5b3f0347201b4a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qa2H4BS9/versions/VIre5UC7/canary-mc1.20.1-0.2.7.jar","filename":"canary-mc1.20.1-0.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":431313,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"6JMd8Cxp","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"canary-mc1.20.1-0.2.7.jar"},"mods\\rubidium-mc1.20.1-0.7.1.jar":{"sha512":"01d73f91e98c5981eb81c7d0a57ab944988108af04781778e1b48a8e4bf35d68091364f65c94f38a903aff09921312118715493f412de916971663f39cf81bce","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4ZqxOvjD","slug":"rubidium","project_type":"mod","team":"CsqDoH4a","title":"Rubidium","description":"Unofficial Fork of CaffeineMC's \"Sodium\", made to work with FML","body":"## **Rubidium is an Unofficial Fork of CaffeineMC's \"Sodium\", made to work with Forge Mod Loader.**\n\n\n# Features\n\nRubidium contains all the features of the classic Sodium.\n<details>\n  <summary>Features</summary>\n  \n- A modern OpenGL rendering pipeline for chunk rendering that takes advantage of multi-draw techniques, allowing for a significant reduction in CPU overhead (~90%) when rendering the world. This can make a huge difference to frame rates for most computers that are not bottle-necked by the GPU or other components. Even if your GPU can't keep up, you'll experience much more stable frame times thanks to the CPU being able to work on other rendering tasks while it waits.\n- Vertex data for rendered chunks is made much more compact, allowing for video memory and bandwidth requirements to be cut by almost 40%.\nNearby block updates now take advantage of multi-threading, greatly reducing lag spikes caused by chunks needing to be updated.\n- Chunk faces which are not visible (or facing away from the camera) are culled very early in the rendering process, eliminating a ton of geometry that would have to be processed on the GPU only to be immediately discarded. For integrated GPUs, this can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and provide a modest speedup even when GPU-bound.\n- Plentiful optimizations for chunk loading and block rendering, making chunk loading significantly faster and less damaging to frame rates.\n- Many optimizations for vertex building and matrix transformations, speeding up block entity, mob, and item rendering significantly for when you get carried away placing too many chests in one room.\n- Many improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n- Many graphical fixes for smooth lighting effects, making the game run better while still applying a healthy amount of optimization.\n- Smooth lighting for fluids and other special blocks.\n- Smooth biome blending for blocks and fluids, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n  \n</details>","published":"2022-07-02T09:36:53.033379Z","updated":"2023-09-24T21:04:19.380872Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":279187,"followers":290,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["52gcrxOy","suKMGRbi","V7JZgyIU","TnN4CV2Q","c4RHSmo9","WTmxKPaw","ibGbqBbP","w6asrex4","JEoSJNGo","v1Byy3O4","qSw3a67v","ySmWhbfP","QrS8ZpUH","lCbMhmSa","Hlexif59","uqcWRM8W","9DCa1IzX","6YKudvQ5","vkRZleVy","iLEHOlRR","17IcFh9q","KoZMxzwB","YDAuLUY8","bmmEZ4mh","VKligEsm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"VKligEsm","project_id":"4ZqxOvjD","author_id":"OGBzw79h","featured":false,"name":"Rubidium mc1.20.1-0.7.1","version_number":"0.7.1","changelog":"- Fully compatible with Connector\n- Compatible with Fabric addons for Sodium provided by Connector (Indium has some problems)\n- Resolved JEI issues\n- Resolved Create crashes (thanks to embeddedt)\n- Upstreamed with new Sodium's optimizations/changes\n- Clouds fixes\n\nOculus should be updated to 1.6.9!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-24T21:04:21.308036Z","downloads":29633,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"01d73f91e98c5981eb81c7d0a57ab944988108af04781778e1b48a8e4bf35d68091364f65c94f38a903aff09921312118715493f412de916971663f39cf81bce","sha1":"9c532360e08cca8c8dd2d94827c24fc7eaac8b4b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/versions/VKligEsm/rubidium-mc1.20.1-0.7.1.jar","filename":"rubidium-mc1.20.1-0.7.1.jar","primary":true,"size":704856,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CsqDoH4a","user":{"id":"OGBzw79h","username":"Asek3","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64613894?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-02T09:26:04.535310Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"rubidium-mc1.20.1-0.7.1.jar"},"mods\\create-1.20.1-0.5.1.e.jar":{"sha512":"8cf77d36573e6b94e707b5b3f17a96d718a7c9de54b2566ce74e17ebcb0ccef07bf8a40f2bd932293ac9a50959c120f7b8af4c6e662c55d88c0e9779d35c1986","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LNytGWDc","slug":"create","project_type":"mod","team":"yyROG8qL","title":"Create","description":"Aesthetic Technology that empowers the Player","body":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rR8W-f9YhYA\" height=\"358\" width=\"638\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Installation Requirements\n\n<p><a href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KAgud6s.png\" width=\"160\" /></a></p>\n<p>This version of Create runs on <a href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\">Minecraft Forge</a> only.<br>You can find the version compatible with the Fabric ecosystem <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric\">here</a>.<br />As of 0.5.1, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flywheel\">Flywheel</a> no longer has to be installed separately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Our Patrons\n\nKyrinon  &#183;

As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")","published":"2021-09-12T18:30:52.613317Z","updated":"2023-10-27T08:19:49.826880Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":73976,"followers":143,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["RcAkwRce","QDfK5kGC","6n1Cz7ld","5aMZMK7v","eUgPCLKt","cNa0vkNj","SPQfFKXA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com//data/iRfIGC1s/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"cNa0vkNj","project_id":"iRfIGC1s","author_id":"fYyU5YhM","featured":true,"name":"Starlight 1.1.2 1.20 - 1.20.1 (Forge)","version_number":"1.1.2+1.20","changelog":"Update to 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-08T06:10:54.244596Z","downloads":17481,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"cc89c6b2dd0db709586028c7732a57a3e6184f19cc2b98b25964c720c3ab434031e62de23e0dab022575d637b5e4a34b5813164d32ec356d56588da400e7d026","sha1":"a915880c7834a0b0f9f300f0e3053deaa9a3205a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRfIGC1s/versions/cNa0vkNj/starlight-1.1.2%2Bforge.1cda73c.jar","filename":"starlight-1.1.2+forge.1cda73c.jar","primary":true,"size":110583,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"st6zzqkJ","user":{"id":"fYyU5YhM","username":"spottedleaf","name":"Spottedleaf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6100722?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-08-29T13:50:25.716250Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"starlight-1.1.2+forge.1cda73c.jar"},"mods\\architectury-9.1.12-forge.jar":{"sha512":"601931a281d2968c52433d6ae967f75aee655c118626a84e114bd6a6ed5fd8134df8bf379ff88d217b2befc953fc4ab55c8cd0d622b1186a9598c0080a400ded","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lhGA9TYQ","slug":"architectury-api","project_type":"mod","team":"72qgsq9X","title":"Architectury API","description":"An intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.","body":"# Architectury API\n\nTalk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/C2RdJDpRBP)!\n\nAn intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

To craft these items you need to make a Rolling Mill which is a kinetic machine that is used to make rods and wires. All the recipes are available through JEI.\n\n## Content:\n- Electric Motor: Generates kinetic energy from Forge Energy, provides a ComputerCraft peripheral.\n- Alternator: Generates Forge Energy from kinetic energy.\n- Rolling Mill: Used to craft Wires and Rods.\n- Creative Generator: Generates a limitless supply of Forge Energy.\n- Connector & Wires: Wires for energy transfer.\n- Redstone Relay: Controls energy flow with Redstone.\n- Accumulator: Multiblock energy storage.\n- Portable Energy Interface: Transfer energy to and from contraptions.\n- Tesla Coil: Charges electric items, and can also be used to inflict damage to Players and Mobs.\n- Digital Adapter: Allows Computercraft computers to talk to various Create blocks (See API).\n- Biomass: Pellet, Fuel.\n- Chocolate and Honey Cake.\n- Diamond Grit Sandpaper.\n- Straw: Applied to a Blaze Burner will give it the ability to burn liquid fuels.\n- Barbed Wire block.\n- Biomass, Biomass Pellet, Sead Oil, and Bioethanol.\n- Various wires, rods, spools, and other crafting components.\n\n### Legacy Features:\n- Induction Heater (Removed in 20220710a): Heats furnaces using Forge Energy (Replaces External Heater from Immersive Engineering).\n- Charging Station (Removed in 20211122a): Charges electric items.\n- Furnace Burner (Removed in 20220709a): Furnace which doesn't require a smelting recipe to run.\n- Crude Burner (Removed in 20220709a): A Furnace Burner that is fueled by liquids such as Seed, Plant, Crude, and Creosote Oil.\n- Accumulator (Replaced with multiblock): Energy storage.\n- Overcharged Hammer: A powerful throwable melee weapon (only in 1.16).\n- Multimeter  (only in 1.16).\n\n### Added Compatibility & Integration:\n- Recipe compatibility with Simple Jetpacks 2 (Electric Jetpacks).\n- Recipe compatibility with Immersive Engineering (External Heater, Lapis Sheet pressing, Sphalerite mineral deposit, Alloys, Treated Wood).\n- Recipe compatibility with Mekanism (Rose Quartz Enriching & Metallurgic Infusing).\n- Recipe compatibility with Tinkers Construct (Alloys).\n- Recipe compatibility with Applied Energistics 2, the Tesla Coil can be used to charge Certus Quartz.\n- Integration with ComputerCraft, the Electric Motor, and more can be used as a peripheral (See API).\n\n## FAQ:\n- What is the recipe for X? - Use JEI to see the current recipes.\n- Can I use this in a modpack? - Yes, distributed with credits to the source on GitHub (Which an unmodified release has), and in accordance with the MIT license.\n- I found a bug, what do I do? - Create an

Crashy is a crash hosting site designed specifically for Not Enough Crashes and Minecraft crashes in general. \nIt shows crashes in an organized GUI that is easily readable, and has some other nice features. [Example](https://crashy.net/2c2vAe5oUVgiNck3NfXU).  \nThere is now a button for uploading directly to crashy in the crash screen. \n- Fixed UTF-specific characters turning into '?' when uploading crash logs.\n- Fixed 'Continuing the game after crashing will cause a crash report to be logged later when the game exits normally'.\n### 3.6.5\n- Forge for 1.17.1!

This fixes not being disconnected from servers.\n### 3.4.4\n- Fixed integrated server crashes not being caught.\n- Fixed state sometimes not being cleaned up properly which could cause the game to infinitely crash.\n### 3.4.3\n- Fixed deobfuscation not working in dedicated servers, courtesy of @Fourmisain!\n### 3.4.2\n- Prevented extreme cases where the crash log could become incredibly large. \n- Fixed the crash screen not showing suspected mods in cases where adding them to the crash log was prevented by conflicting mods.\n### 3.4.1\n- Improved internal error message.\n## 3.4.0\n- Provided many configuration options for uploading the crash logs, see NecConfig.java, thanks to The456Gamer!\n- The config format for uploading crash logs has changed, refer to NecConfig.java for the new format. \n## 3.3.1\n- Fixed mod identification not working.\n- Fixed deobfuscation sometimes not working.\n- Promoted to Release!\n## 3.3.0\n- Updated to Minecraft 1.17, Java 16. \n- Currently buggy, this is a minimum viable alpha release.\n## 3.2.0\n- Added a new option `forceCrashScreen` that will prevent cases in which the game closes with no crash log.

how worlds are loaded to speed up loading times.","body":"# NOTICE!!!!!!\nI (StockiesLad) have quit modding again. This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":672736,"followers":1058,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"5caSj7kt","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Fastload 3.4.0 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-3.4.0","changelog":"bump version.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-15T12:36:55.631401Z","downloads":22440,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"27d58f123951e0404c94caf16ff9b96b442f371c","sha512":"b8be6ed0bef707c7c34d84049eb68313a5c787f6e9c9a88fb94daed6bccfedc6c181a1fca431f53b6e8ac03c7baf7653414b5a5792cab6b500c6d66502489431"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/5caSj7kt/Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":66989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"JoostMSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a student Software Engineer that codes websites and mods for games.

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-09-22T17:07:54.581205Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2249807,"followers":3276,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"17Hi340V","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 -

To edit/disable smooth zooming, edit the `lerp_amount` config option. To disable smooth zooming, set its value to `0`.\n\n### Smooth Camera on Zoom\nThe smooth/cinematic camera is enabled by default when zooming. To disable this, set `smooth_camera_on_zoom` to `false`.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use Just Zoom in modpacks.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n**To my patrons:**\n- OtakuGamer\n- Kreezxil\n- q!!!\n- Jolihan\n\n## Copyright\n\nJust Zoom Copyright © 2021 Keksuccino.<br>\nJust Zoom is licensed under DSMSL (DON'T SNATCH MA STUFF LICENSE).<br>\nSee GitHub for more information about the license.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/keksuccino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/100003401-505d5300-2dc6-11eb-9444-3dd117a8aef9.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"244\" /></a><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><br /></span></p>","published":"2023-06-09T23:36:39.409185Z","updated":"2023-09-24T05:25:21.170812Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":11616,"followers":15,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["81bqvjrS","nYoZGwmu","G2VLRt4r","Q1byKePB","WSOuEyWT","MSieP4h1","kUbvKIxI","k3lm0FzI","Yd9leUAD","AjsXN2Tc","mLF7LVql"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iAiqcykM/086f0578fb6af5f45b60d4ac966df8b2bbda4b76.png"},"version":{"id":"k3lm0FzI","project_id":"iAiqcykM","author_id":"k0LcYHWE","featured":false,"name":"[Forge] v1.0.2 MC 1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.2-1.20.1-forge","changelog":"\n<br>CHANGELOG | JUST ZOOM v1.0.2\n \n<br>- Added: Support for MC 1.20.1\n<br>- Added: Smooth zoom (can be modified/disabled by editing the 'lerp_amount' config option) (Big thanks to EDM115 for the PR!)\n<br>- Added: Config option to disable the smooth camera movement when zoomed\n \n<br>- Fixed: Scroll-zooming in too much results in \"ghost zooming\"\n\n<br>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-13T05:13:41.358995Z","downloads":7144,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f4a4becc5d7b9c8dbdc59f65e011620ddee6a7f2ce3b147c50741d60ccf8b3d6d6ec8f6e5963f335ebae103a2cef58a373657f63d2e02763c5c2fef4bd555c7e","sha1":"016cb38a9e59c95392a25da8f6f19d337f80360a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iAiqcykM/versions/k3lm0FzI/justzoom_forge_1.0.2_MC_1.20.1.jar","filename":"justzoom_forge_1.0.2_MC_1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":9151,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"eee38aef5de1514dc061b85564e82229959a6c11e28c9217e9f27b9ab31a4fecfcf2517116260712204136a3db04e2b8383a0f7f7d9b88f17daa0261e074fae2","sha1":"6d7796950f36f2a0f43b7cbea6925403735209f7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iAiqcykM/versions/k3lm0FzI/dev_justzoom_forge_1.0.2_MC_1.20.1.jar","filename":"dev_justzoom_forge_1.0.2_MC_1.20.1.jar","primary":false,"size":11917,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"J81TRJWm","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"brmoyUbE","user":{"id":"k0LcYHWE","username":"keksuccino","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35544624?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-03-30T18:22:57.742857Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"justzoom_forge_1.0.2_MC_1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\EnchantmentDescriptions-Forge-1.20.1-17.0.8.jar":{"sha512":"d323658202cabdf4f01e491a0a0b44bb208f35e13f8543107b745a7e646be1187f55a3d04ad193236949b108e747d57031970ff17f2b77186ee09d02fc9dc19f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"UVtY3ZAC","slug":"enchantment-descriptions","project_type":"mod","team":"jJHDf5Y8","title":"Enchantment Descriptions","description":"Provides a way to get enchantment descriptions from enchanted books.","body":"# Enchantment Descriptions\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Enchantment Descriptions is a light weight client-side mod that adds descriptions of enchantments to the tool tip of enchanted books.
